# Rube Codeberg submission for Craig Quirke

This is a Rube Codeberg attempt by myself for submission to the pyconline AU 2020 Rube Codeberg competition.
It makes use of requests, and Beautiful soup to retrieve the rules of the competition from the sunday program page.
Grabs each rule text in  **BOLD** in the rules.
Selects a random page in the programming languages category on wikipedia for each letter, and outputs the count of that character (case insensitive). 
Check the vertical column 'Char' for 'Hello world!'
