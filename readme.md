# Rube Codeberg submission for Craig Quirke

This is a Rube Codeberg attempt by myself for submission to the pyconline AU 2020 Rube Codeberg competition.
It makes use of [Requests: HTTP for Humansâ„¢](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to retrieve the rules of the competition from the sunday program page.
Grabs each rule text in  **BOLD** in the rules.
Selects a random page in the programming languages category on wikipedia for each letter, and outputs the count of that character (case insensitive). 
Check the vertical column 'Char' for 'Hello world!'
